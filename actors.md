# Actor Types in Scientific Research

In the ontology of scientific research, actor types are defined as the various entities that participate in, contribute to, and influence the ecosystem of scientific inquiry and knowledge dissemination. These actors play critical roles in the processes that drive research from conception through to application. The following table outlines these actor types, providing a description and examples to illustrate the diversity within each category.
