# Ontology of Scientific Research

## Abstract

This repository hosts an ontology designed to conceptualize and structure the complex ecosystem of scientific research. It provides a comprehensive framework that outlines the roles of various actors and subprocesses involved in the generation, dissemination, and application of scientific knowledge. The ontology aims to facilitate a deeper understanding of the interrelations and dependencies within the scientific research community, offering insights into how research activities are conducted, supported, and utilized.

The ontology is divided into three main components:

1. **Actor Types**: Defines the key participants in the scientific research ecosystem, including their roles and contributions. Actors range from researchers and teams to institutions that fund, oversee, apply, and support research endeavors.

2. **Subprocesses**: Describes the series of actions, methodologies, and procedures that constitute the research process. This includes everything from the initial planning and funding stages to the publication, documentation, and operationalization of research findings.

3. **Relationships**: Outlines the dynamic interactions between actors and subprocesses. This section highlights how various entities collaborate, support, and influence each other within the research ecosystem.

## Repository Organization

The content of this ontology is organized into separate markdown files within the repository, as follows:

- **Actor Types**: A detailed description of each actor involved in the scientific research ecosystem. [Link to Actor Types Markdown File]

- **Subprocesses**: An overview of the processes that underpin scientific research, detailing each subprocess's role and function. [Link to Subprocesses Markdown File]

- **Relationships**: Explores the intricate web of relationships that connect actors and subprocesses, illustrating the collaborative and interdependent nature of scientific research. [Link to Relationships Markdown File]

## Purpose

The development of this ontology serves multiple purposes. Primarily, it acts as a structured representation of the scientific research domain, aiding in the analysis, study, and enhancement of research practices. Additionally, it aims to provide a common language for stakeholders across the research landscape, promoting clearer communication and understanding among researchers, institutions, and policymakers.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions from the scientific research community and other interested stakeholders. Whether you have suggestions for refining the ontology, additional insights into actor roles or subprocesses, or new relationships to consider, please feel free to open an issue. Forking is also encouraged but please cite this repo.
