# Scientific Research Ontology

## Overview

The Scientific Research Ontology provides a structured framework to understand and analyze the complex ecosystem of scientific research. This ontology includes detailed descriptions of the actors involved, the subprocesses that constitute research activities, and the relationships that tie these elements together. It serves as a comprehensive guide for exploring the intricate dynamics of scientific research, facilitating a deeper understanding for researchers, policymakers, and anyone interested in the science of science.

## Contents

- **[Actor Types](https://github.com/mzargham/Scientific-Research-Ontology/blob/main/ACTORS.md)**: Detailed descriptions of the entities participating in the scientific research ecosystem, including their roles, contributions, and examples.

- **[Subprocesses](https://github.com/mzargham/Scientific-Research-Ontology/blob/main/SUBPROCESSES.md)**: An overview of the processes underpinning scientific research, detailing each subprocess's purpose and function.

- **[Relationships](https://github.com/mzargham/Scientific-Research-Ontology/blob/main/RELATIONSHIPS.md)**: Explorations of the dynamic interactions between actors and subprocesses, illustrating the collaborative and interdependent nature of scientific research.

- **[Actor Process Niches](actor_niches.md)**: A discussion on the specific niches occupied by each actor within the research ecosystem, emphasizing their unique yet interconnected roles.

- **[Detailed Actor Relationships](https://github.com/mzargham/Scientific-Research-Ontology/blob/main/ACTOR_BY_SUBPROCESSES.md)**: A comprehensive look at the nuanced relationships between actors and subprocesses, highlighting the fractal nature of funding and application in scientific research.

## Purpose

This ontology aims to provide a common framework to facilitate discussions, analyses, and policy-making in scientific research. By delineating the roles of various actors and the processes they engage in, we seek to foster a clearer understanding of how scientific knowledge is generated, disseminated, and applied. This, in turn, can help in identifying areas for improvement, innovation, and collaboration within the research community.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions from the scientific research community and other interested stakeholders. Whether you have suggestions for refining the ontology, additional insights into actor roles or subprocesses, or new relationships to consider, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
