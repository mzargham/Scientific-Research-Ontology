# Relationships in Scientific Research

The ontology of scientific research identifies the intricate web of relationships between various actor types and subprocesses, illustrating how entities collaborate, influence, and support each other within the research ecosystem. These relationships form a bipartite graph, connecting actors to specific subprocesses and highlighting their roles and contributions. This document provides an overview of these relationships, detailing how each actor type engages with different subprocesses.
