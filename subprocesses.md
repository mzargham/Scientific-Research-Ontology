# Subprocesses in Scientific Research

Subprocesses in the ontology of scientific research represent the various actions, methodologies, and procedures that are fundamental to conducting, disseminating, and applying scientific knowledge. These subprocesses encapsulate the essential steps and stages through which research data and findings are generated, validated, shared, and utilized. The following table provides an overview of these subprocesses, including a description and examples to illustrate their application and importance.

## Note to Readers

This document is designed to serve as an introductory overview of the key subprocesses involved in scientific research. Each subprocess is critical to the integrity, progression, and impact of scientific inquiry. As the ontology expands, we anticipate adding detailed markdown files for each subprocess to delve into specifics, methodologies, and case studies.

Contributions to expand on these subprocesses, refine their descriptions, or add examples are highly encouraged. If you have insights, additional subprocesses to consider, or wish to contribute to the development of subprocess-specific documentation, please engage with this repository.
